Running pyElectrode from the source:

* This software was developed in python 2.7 under Fedora 16 (August, 2012) and was
successfully tested under Ubuntu 12.04. The following libraries are needed 
to run the sources:

- python 2.7
- numpy and scipy http://www.scipy.org/Download
- PyQt http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
- matplotlib>=1.1.0 http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
- pydicom>=0.9.7 http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/

All those libraries are available for Windows, MacOs and linux platforms.
Once those libraries are installed, to run the program simply type:

python pyElectrode.py

in the console/terminal.

==============================================================


Running pyElectrode from the self-executable program:

* The Windows version was compiled under windows 7 professional 64 bit. 

* The compiled versions take longer to start because they must first
uncompress a micro python bundle.

Bug Reports


* When reporting a bug / problem, please describe the problem as completely as you can 
and include as much information about the operating system and environment as possible.

If the program crashes, the software will send an error message to the command window
(for compiled versions) and in the  console when used with the source.
